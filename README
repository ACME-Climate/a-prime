Python based scripts to generate plots of the coupled ACME model 

To use on OLCF: 

I. One time System set-up:
	1. execute "csh install_basemap.csh" to put basemap software onto your system.
	   (if your system has this already you can skip this step) Check pointers to 
	   directories to make sure your machines uses the macros

II. Set case specific variables:
	1. Where marked, set case specific variables in run_RHEA.csh:
		casename:    name of the model run case
		archive_dir: location of case output files
		native_res:  resolution of the case (e.g. ne30, ne120)
		short_term_archive: Is the short term archiving directory structure being used? 1 = True, 0 = False
				    e.g. ...$casename/atm/hist, ...$casename/ocn/hist
		
	   That file is the driver and calls the atm and ocn diags files.

	2. Point to the right observational data, mapping files and output locations if the defaults are not optimal:
		data_dir: 	            location of the observational data files

		GPCP_regrid_wgt_file:       location of mapping file for interpolation from native_res to GPCP grid.
		CERES_EBAF_regrid_wgt_file: location of mapping file for interpolation from native_res to CERES_EBAF grid
		ERS_regrid_wgt_file: 	    location of mapping file for interpolation from native_res to ERS grid.


		scratch_dir:                location to put intermediate files and data files used for making final plots.
		plots_dir: 		    location where the plot images are saved
		log_dir:                    location where the log files are saved
		www_dir:		    location of a public www folder if available for posting plots

	3. Switch on the diagnostics required
		generate_prect
		generate_rad
		generate_wind_stress

	4. Switch on html index.html generation:
		generate_html

	5. Execute "csh run_RHEA.csh" to run the diagnostics and create an html file.



To use on LLNL AIMS: 

I. One time System set-up:
	1. The scripts should make sure you are pointing to the correct uvcdat based python, numpy etc.
	   But if not, then alter this path:
	   source /usr/local/uvcdat/latest/bin/setup_runtime.sh
	2. make sure you have set the path for NCL in your .bashrc
	   export NCARG_ROOT=/user/local/src/NCL-6.3.0
	   and set your PATH:
	   export PATH=/usr/local/src/NCL-6.3.0:$PATH
	3. Execute "csh run_AIMS.csh" to run the diagnostics and create an html file.

II. Set case specific variables:
	1. Where marked, set case specific variables in run_AIMS.csh:
		casename:    name of the model run case
		archive_dir: location of case output files
		native_res:  resolution of the case (e.g. ne30, ne120)
		short_term_archive: Is the short term archiving directory structured being used? 1 = True, 0 = False
				    e.g. ...$casename/atm/hist, ...$casename/ocn/hist
		
	   That file is the driver and calls the atm and ocn diags files.

	   The script currently expects the directory structure of ACME short term archiving,
	   i.e. .../casename/atm/hist for the atmosphere.

	2. Point to the right observational data, mapping files and output locations if the defaults are not optimal:
		data_dir: 	            location of the observational data files

		GPCP_regrid_wgt_file:       location of mapping file for interpolation from native_res to GPCP grid.
		CERES_EBAF_regrid_wgt_file: location of mapping file for interpolation from native_res to CERES_EBAF grid
		ERS_regrid_wgt_file: 	    location of mapping file for interpolation from native_res to ERS grid.


		scratch_dir:                location to put intermediate files and data files used for making final plots.
		plots_dir: 		    location where the plot images are saved
		log_dir:                    location where the log files are saved
		www_dir:		    location of a public www folder if available for posting plots

	3. Switch on the diagnostics required
		generate_prect
		genearte_rad
		generate_wind_stress

	4. Switch on html index.html generation:
		generate_html

	5. Execute "csh run_AIMS.csh" to run the diagnostics and create an html file.




To do:

1. Generate separate log files for each module for improved readability.
