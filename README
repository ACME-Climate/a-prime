python based scripts to generate plots of the coupled ACME model 

To use on OLCF: 
1. execute "csh install_basemap.csh" to put basemap software onto your system.
(if your system has this already you can skip this step) Check pointers to 
directories to make sure your machines uses the macros
2. Where marked, set variables in the ACME_coupled_diags.csh, or its parallel cousin,
ACME_coupled_diags_parallel.csh, point to the right data and output locations.
3. execute "csh ACME_coupled_diags.csh" ot create the png files in the output directory.
4 in output directory, execute "display file.png" to view the plot.

To use on LLNL AIMS: 
1. Where marked, set variables in the run_AIMS.csh. to point to the right data and output locations.
That file is the driver and calls the atm and ocn diags files
The scripts should make sure you are pointing to the correct uvcdat based python, numpy etc.
but if not, then alter this path:
source /usr/local/uvcdat/latest/bin/setup_runtime.sh
4. make sure you have set the path for NCL in your .bashrc
export NCARG_ROOT=/user/local/src/NCL-6.3.0
and set your PATH:
export PATH=/usr/local/src/NCL-6.3.0:$PATH

Jan 2016, added Precip plots with placeholders to add ocean and radiation plots
March 2016, added Radiation plots

To do:
